SetUp for Development servers

1. get static ip
2. use dhcp router as gateway (assume 192.168.1.1 as gateway address)
3. setup development server with a fixed dhcp address (assume 192.168.1.33)
4. on router, direct tcp traffic on ports 5432, 8080, 22 to dev server
5. on dev server ensure incoming connections are allow on the above ports (Mac SysPrefs Sharing)
6. setup postgres as normal
7.  => add entry in  pg_hba.conf to allow connections from 192.168.1.1 (see 
       example pg_hba.conf in this directory)
8.  => add entry in  postgresql.conf to allow listen on port 5432 (see 
       example postgresql.conf in this directory)
9. restart postgres:
   pg_ctl -D /Users/larry/Development/cluster -l /Users/larry/Development/cluster/log.txt restart
9. setup tomcat as normal, ensuring that the manager application is running
   and you know the user name and password for an admin (see example tomcat-users.xml
   is this directory)
10. create a deployment property file for webapp

Done.
