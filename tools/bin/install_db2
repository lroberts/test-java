1) 57016 - "the table cannot be accessed because it is inactive"
   - after you've made any change to the table (via alter ..) it becomes 'inactive'
   - you need to 'update statistics' for that table:
     REORGCHK UPDATE STATISTICS on TABLE db2inst1.person

     - which gave error: -668
     REORGCHK UPDATE STATISTICS on TABLE ALL (same result)

   - more googling informed me the table might be in a 'check pending' state, and
     that the command:

      select tabname,status,const_checked from syscat.tables where status='C'

     would tell me if this was the case, but it said:
TABNAME                                                                                                                          STATUS CONST_CHECKED                   
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------ --------------------------------

  0 record(s) selected.

   - doing this:  ? sql0668  (ie. replacing the '-' with 'sql0'
     gives you the equivalent help (instead of ? 57016, which doesn't work for ? -668)

     on this help page it says you can see if a LOAD operation has finished
     by asking:
         LOAD QUERY TABLE person

     which gave:
         Tablestate:
            Reorg Pending
 
     executing:  REORG TABLE person
     fixed the problem

2) 8 character  database names

3) the table pagesize/bufferpools stuff apparently to save an extra 16k

4) crappy commandline tools that don't use the readline library or have any command history
   and (probably only by default) are unable to handle both delete and backspace

5) no boolean or bit datatype
